# Test backend - Niveau 1

## Exam

1. Objective
   Develop a robust APIs for managing products, categories, suppliers, dynamic filters, optimized
   pagination for continuous loading (infinite scroll).
   The API must be scalable, secure, and provide a smooth interaction with the front-end.
2. Database & Figma
   Database will be provided when talking test.
   Figma Link:
   https://www.figma.com/design/dfTzvBVPK3HdZB5XartT9s/Test---FE?node-id=0-1&t=qvJDo4KCVgkZ7w6x-1
3. API
   Imagine the APIs necessary for the correct display of data as presented on Figma
4. Item Range Management for a Scrollable Board
   Implementation
   - Optimize product loading for a smooth display on a scrollable board.
   - Avoid initial loading of thousands of rows by retrieving products in batches.
   - Dynamic filter and incremental search
   - Create an API that generates a formatted PDF file of product data in the back end.
   - Create an APi to calculate the distance in km between a location (ip) and a city where a
     product produced is located.
5. Date Format Validation (Regex)
   All date fields should follow the YYYY-MM-DD format.
6. Product Statistics
   Retrieve statistics on product distribution per category and supplier.
